                &nbsp;tool for sharing the costs of regular grocery trips with a larger group of people,
                making it easier to pool a grocery order for better economies of scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trips are added manually by an administrator, after which customers can add a list of the items they'd like to
                purchase from each supermarket. They can even add items from several different supermarkets to their orders.
                The items to add can be found on the relevant supermarkets' websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the deadline for adding items is reached and the order is placed with the supermarket(s), an invoice
                is automatically sent to all users who made a purchase via Stripe. Payments are made directly via Stripe,
                not on this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                All transactions will be made in <strong>Â£GBP</strong>.
            </p>

                Refunds
            </h2>
            <p>
                Occasionally, a supermarket may substitute an item for a cheaper alternative or cancel it entirely,
                refunding the difference. In such cases, a credit will be applied to the customer's account, which can be
                used as a discount on their next order. Alternatively, they can also ask for a refund to their payment method
                (e.g. debit card or bank account).
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, if a mistake is made while placing the order (e.g. an item is missed out) the customer will get
                a credit/refund applied to their account.
            </p>
